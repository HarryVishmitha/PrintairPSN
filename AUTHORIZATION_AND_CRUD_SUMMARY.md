});
```

### Working Groups Authorization

public function manageMembers(User $user, WorkingGroup $workingGroup)
{
    return $user->hasAnyRole(['super-admin', 'admin', 'manager']);
}
```

### Activity Logging

activity()
    ->performedOn($workingGroup)
    ->causedBy($request->user())
    ->log('custom description');
